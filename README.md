ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project presents a Power BI dashboard built to help organizations track their projects more effectively. The dashboard brings together financials, progress, and workload distribution into a single view, making it easier for management to spot what’s on track, what’s delayed, and where resources need attention.

By visualizing key aspects like budgets, timelines, priorities, and project types, it provides clarity and accountability across the portfolio. The goal is to enable data-driven decisions, improve transparency, and support timely interventions—ensuring projects deliver value while staying aligned with organizational objectives.
